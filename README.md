# Metronome

A simple web-metronome

Because the other ones suck

## Todo

* Get something going with webworkers to allow the metronome to run even when not the active tab
	* Chrome doesn't let setInterval fire at its normal rate when the tab is changed
* More sounds?
* Better support for different screen sizes
